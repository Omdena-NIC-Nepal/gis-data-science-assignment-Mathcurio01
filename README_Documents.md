# Climate Data Analysis for Nepal

## Overview
This project uses GIS Data Science techniques to analyze climate data for Nepal. It involves reading data, visualizing climate patterns, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

## Objectives and Tasks
- **Analyze GIS Climate Data:** Explore temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables.
- **Data Processing:** Read and preprocess the data using Python libraries.
- **Visualization:** Create maps and plots to illustrate climate trends.
- **EDA:** Compute statistics, identify trends, and extract insights from the data.

## Environment Setup and Running Scripts
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omdena-NIC-Nepal/gis-data-science-assignment-Mathcurio01.git
   ```

2. **Install the Libraries**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn 
    ```
3. **Run the Scripts**
    ```bash
    python gis_assignment.ipynb
    ```
## Data Sources and Preprocessing

### Data Sources:
- Climate data for Nepal is obtained from source:
```
https://github.com/Desmondonam/Nepal_Climate_change
```

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Read the data using **geopandas** or similar libraries.
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and correcting data types.
- Convert coordinate reference systems if required.

## Visualizations

### Climate Trend Map:
- A map that displays temperature or precipitation trends over time. This visualization helps in understanding regional climate patterns.

### Additional Visualizations:
- Other charts (e.g., line graphs, histograms) are used to highlight statistical trends and anomalies.

## EDA Findings

### Statistical Summary:
- Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) reveal overall climate behavior.

### Trend Analysis:
- Seasonal variations and regional differences are identified.

### Insights:
- Observations from the EDA suggest areas with significant climate variation, informing further analysis and potential climate resilience strategies.

## Conclusion
- This assignment demonstrates the practical application of GIS Data Science in understanding and visualizing climate data for Nepal.
